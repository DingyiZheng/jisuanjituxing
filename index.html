<h1 align="middle">Assignment 4: Len Simulator</h1>
    <h2 align="middle">Dingyi Zheng( ID:539936 )</h2>

    <div class="padded">
        <p><em>OVERVIEW: </em>the main idea of this assignment is to make a simulation of a camera which can focus on different depth. To achieve this, we the use ray tracing method that we implemented in last assignment but add a set of lens in front of the sensor plane. So that before the light coming directly into the sensor, it will go through the lens and thus be refracted accordingly.  </p>


        <p>Use this section to write an overview of the assignment. All of the text in your write-up should be <em>in your own words</em>. If you need to add additional HTML features to this document, you can search the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">http://www.w3schools.com/</a> website for instructions. To edit the HTML, you can just copy and paste existing chunks and fill in the text and image file names appropriately.</p>
        <o>The website writeup is intended to be a self-contained walkthrough of the assignment: we want this to be a piece of work which showcases your understanding of relevant concepts through both mesh images as well as written explanations about what you did to complete each part of the assignment. Try to be as clear and organized as possible when writing about your own output files or extensions to the assignment. We want to understand what you've achieved and how you've done it!</p> 
        <p>If you are well-versed in web development, feel free to ditch this template and make a better looking page. Just make sure that you include all the components as we've laid them out here. </p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Tracing Rays through Lenses</h2>
        <p>For part one, I simulated the process that rays pass through lens set. The first step is to test whether the ray intersects a lenselement or not. The lenselement is a part of a sphere, which has a center lies in the location of a sphere center, has a radius which equals the sphere radius, and has a aperture which is the diameter of the lenselement. Thus the test of intersection is between a ray and a sphere, just like what we did in the last assignment, the difference is that for the lenselement, we need to use aperture size for further test.</p>
        <o>The second task is to reflect the light ray once it hit a lenselement. One tricky thing for this is the io rate are different between trace forward and backward.</p>
        <o> <b>Explane the difference between pinhole camera and lens system: </b>A pinhole camera is a camera with no lens.It has a small hole to let the lights go straightly from outside world to the inside sensor. Pinhole canmera has infinite depth of field and do not has a specific focus, as no matter where the sensor plane has been placed, it would always get a clear image. For pinhole camera, all we can change is the sensor depth and the time of exposure.The lens system camera has more parameters and degree of freedom. Since lights are not coming through a small hole, 
        a sigle point in the world space can shoot a beam of light through the aperture, thus might form a very blur image on the sensor. However, the lens can refract the light to get a focus. Focus of a lens is determined by the refractive rate of the lens. To zoom in and zoom out is to change the distance between a lens and the sensor plane and can not be achieved by a pinhole camera.</p>

        <p>Here is an example of how to include a simple formula:</p>
        <p align="middle"><pre align="middle">a^2 + b^2 = c^2</pre></p>
        <p>or, alternatively, you can include an SVG image of a LaTex formula.</p>
        <p>This time it's your job to copy-paste in the rest of the sections :)</p>



    <h2 align="middle">A Few Notes On Webpages</h2>
        <p>Here are a few problems students have encountered in the past. You will probably encounter these problems at some point, so don't wait until right before the deadline to check that everything is working. Test your website on the instructional machines early!</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Your main report page should be called index.html.</li>
        <li>Be sure to include and turn in all of the other files (such as images) that are linked in your report!</li>
        <li>Use only <em>relative</em> paths to files, such as <pre>"./images/image.jpg"</pre>
        Do <em>NOT</em> use absolute paths, such as <pre>"/Users/student/Desktop/image.jpg"</pre></li>
        <li>Pay close attention to your filename extensions. Remember that on UNIX systems (such as the instructional machines), capitalization matters. <pre>.png != .jpeg != .jpg != .JPG</pre>
        <li>Be sure to adjust the permissions on your files so that they are world readable. For more information on this please see this tutorial: <a href="http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Permissions.html">http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Permissions.html</a></li>
        <li>And again, test your website on the instructional machines early!</li>
